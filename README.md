#.1 About the Project
The rise of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has revolutionized the way 
media content is created and consumed. However, it has also led to the proliferation of deepfake 
technologies, which enable the generation of highly convincing synthetic media, including fake 
audio. Audio deepfakes leverage AI models to mimic human voices with astonishing accuracy, 
making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake recordings.
Fake audio poses serious threats in various domains:
Fraud and Impersonation: Used in scams to mimic voices for financial gain or to breach 
security systems.
Misinformation: Spread of fake information through manipulated audio.
Reputational Damage: False audio clips targeting individuals or organizations.
The ability to reliably detect fake audio has therefore become critical in combating these 
challenges. This project, "Fake Audio Detection System," is designed to address this need by 
leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients 
(MFCCs) for accurate and efficient detection of synthetic audio.
